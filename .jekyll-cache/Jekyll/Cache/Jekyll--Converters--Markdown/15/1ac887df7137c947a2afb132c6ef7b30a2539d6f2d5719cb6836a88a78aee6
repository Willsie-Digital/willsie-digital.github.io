I"<p>In order to get started with Jekyll, please have a look at the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">official Jekyll website</a> first.</p>

<p>It basically explains everything you’ll need to know how to <strong>install Jekyll on your system</strong> accordingly.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of the terminal or console by the way, it’s really not as difficult as it might seems at first sight. I’ll do my very best to guide you through rest of the theme setup process afterwards.</p>

<p>Please feel free to send me an email to <strong>hello[at]indiqo.eu</strong> at any time if you should get stuck or have problems — <em>I’ll see what I can do in order to help you out</em>.</p>

<p>Now that you got the latest version of Jekyll, it’s time to build our first website.</p>

<p>In order to do that, you’ll have to <strong>extract the theme archive first</strong> to a directory of your choice. Depending on your operating system, an unarchiver might be preinstalled already or you can use applications like <a href="http://www.winzip.de">WinZip</a> for Windows or <a href="http://archiverapp.com">Archiver</a> for OSX.</p>

		<div class="caption" data-animation="fadeInUp">
		  
		  
		  	<h4>Archiver Website</h4>
		  

		  
		  	<p>It's just a good old zip archive so any of them will work perfectly fine</p>

<p><strong>Good job!</strong> As you can see, the theme includes various different files and folders.</p>

<p>In order to understand the directory structure a little more and to get to know what each file and folder does, I’d like to refer you back to the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">Jekyll documentation</a> which is rather useful and quite comprehensive.</p>

<div class="media image" data-animation="fadeInUp">

	
		<img src="/images/directory-structure.jpg" alt="Directory Structure" />
	

	
		<div class="caption" data-animation="fadeInUp">
		  
		  
		  	<h4>Directory Structure</h4>
		  

		  
		  	<p>It should pretty much look like this now</p>

</div>

<p>To turn the theme and sample data into a static website now, please <strong>open up your terminal or console</strong> and change the directory (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>) you’re currently in to your unzipped themes folder.</p>

<div class="media image" data-animation="fadeInUp">

	
		<img src="/images/change-directory.jpg" alt="Change Directory" />
	

	
		<div class="caption" data-animation="fadeInUp">
		  
		  
		  	<h4>Change Directory</h4>
		  

		  
		  	<p>Useful hint: Just enter 'cd' into the terminal or console and drag the theme folder into the window before hitting enter — works perfectly at least on OSX</p>
		  

		  

		</div>
	

</div>

<p>Now let the magic happen and <strong>build the site</strong> by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> or start a local webserver via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>.</p>

<p>A new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> will be created which includes the entire website ready to be pushed to your webserver via FTP for example.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that Jekyll <strong>sites are meant to run on webservers and not on file systems</strong> which means that links and references are relative. If you open up one of the generated HTML pages locally, they most likely won’t be styled at all, images won’t show up and links can be broken at least particularly.</p>

<p><strong>That’s normal and intended so don’t panic!</strong></p>

<p>Just push the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder to your webserver or start a local one and you’ll see that it works just the way it should. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> does that for you as well by the way and you can access it by opening <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code> in your browser.</p>
