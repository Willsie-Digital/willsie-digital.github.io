<p>You already know how to <em>create posts and pages</em> and <em>what front-matter means</em>. But did you also know that front-matter is a <strong>seriously powerful way to control contents and appearance</strong> of each page?</p>

<p>Meet the advanced, optional front-matter you can add to the top of each post or page.</p>

<div class="media image" data-animation="fadeInUp">

	
		<img src="/images/advanced-front-matter.jpg" alt="Advanced front-matter" />
	

	
		<div class="caption" data-animation="fadeInUp">
		  
		  
		  	<h4>Advanced front-matter</h4>
		  

		  
		  	<p>This is the front-matter of the page you're currently viewing</p>
		  

		  

		</div>
	

</div>

<p>Below youâ€™ll see a <em>detailed description of each of these options</em>, what they do and how you can use them in order to control many aspects of the page easily â€” Iâ€™ll skip <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> though.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>navigation:</strong> Can be either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> and controls wether the post or page appears in the navigation or not. This just works if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> is either set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>date:</strong> Itâ€™s a good practice to set the date within each file as well even though itâ€™s not required. The order of all posts and pages added to the navigation depends on their date too.</li>
  <li><strong>excerpt:</strong> A <strong>quick summary</strong> which shows up on top of each page as well as on the homepage listing.</li>
  <li><strong>categories:</strong> Add one or more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories</code> for each page or post â€” theyâ€™re part of the excerpt and influence the way Jekyll builds the sites hierarchy.</li>
  <li><strong>gradient:</strong> Specify a number between 1 and 5 to define the <strong>color of the gradient</strong> applied to the header of the post or page.</li>
  <li><strong>image:</strong> Add an image to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> folder and add its file name here so it shows up on top of the page. The <strong>perfect size would be 1200 x 700px</strong> but everything should work just fine considering that it will be scaled accordingly anyway.</li>
  <li><strong>details:</strong> Can be either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> and specifies wether the header image selected for this page will show up in the homepage listing as well.</li>
  <li><strong>author:</strong> Feel free to add the name of the posts or pages author.</li>
  <li><strong>bio:</strong> A short description or bio can be appended too.</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining front-matter should be self-explanatory in my opinion and youâ€™re able to <em>attach various social media profile links</em> to the authors profile.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind though that <strong>links usually include colons and these are reserved by YAML</strong>. That said, make sure that you wrap links (and literally anything else which might include colons) into quotes so they donâ€™t break it.</p>
